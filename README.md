[![Binder](https://beta.mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/PHI-Case-Studies/2019-Case-Builder/master) [![Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/launch.png)](https://notebooks.azure.com/import/gh/PHI-Case-Studies/2019-Case-Builder)

## TLDR;
This is a set of [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) to introduce **digital case studies**. Click on the BinderHub or the Azure Notebooks link above. Wait a few minutes for the binder or Microsoft Azure Notebook to complete its setup and launch. 

## For Microsoft Azure Notebook
1. To use Microsoft Azure Notebook to launch this GitHub repository, you need to create an account at https://notebooks.azure.com.
2. If you see the popup window below, this means the packages required to run notebooks are still being installed. The window will disappear when package installation is complete.
